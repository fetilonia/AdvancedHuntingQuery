## Query

```

| where isnotempty(RecipientEmailAddress)
| extend suspiciousEmailFlag = iff(ThreatTypes has_any ("Spam","Phish","Malware"),1,0)
| summarize emailReceivedCount = count() by suspiciousEmailFlag, RecipientEmailAddress, Timestamp
| summarize avgEmailReceived = avg(emailReceivedCount), avgSuspiciousEmail = avg(suspiciousEmailFlag*30) by bin(Timestamp, 3h)
| serialize
//| extend movAvgEmailReceived = (avgEmailReceived + prev(avgEmailReceived,1,0) + prev(avgEmailReceived,2,0))/3.0
//| extend movAvgSuspiciousEmail = (avgSuspiciousEmail + prev(avgSuspiciousEmail,1,0) + prev(avgSuspiciousEmail,2,0))/0.5
