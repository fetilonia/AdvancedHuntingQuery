## Query

```Kusto
â€‹// Look for PowerShell commands that connect to remote hosts
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(1d)
// Pivot on PowerShell processes
| where InitiatingProcessFileName  in~("powershell.exe", "powershell_ise.exe")
// Look for -encodedcommands, which can be 
// abbreviated all the way down to just -e
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine hasprefix "-e"
// Split the commands on spaces
| extend SplitString = split(InitiatingProcessCommandLine, " ")
// Move the results into an array
| mvexpand SS = SplitString 
// Look for Base64 based on regex pattern
| where SS matches regex "^[A-Za-z0-9+/]{50,}[=]{0,2}$"
// Decode Base64 and removing nul character
| extend DecodeString = replace("\\0", "", base64_decodestring(tostring(SS)))
| where DecodeString has "proxy" and DecodeString 
has_any("webclient", "downloadfile", "downloadstring", "webrequest")
